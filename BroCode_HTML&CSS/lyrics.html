            First things first: rest in peace, Uncle Phil
            For real
            You the only father that I ever knew
            I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you
            Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville
            Fulfilled
            Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill
            Martin Luther King woulda been on Dreamville, talk to a nigga
            
            [Pre-Chorus]
            One time for my L.A. sisters
            One time for my L.A. ho
            Lame niggas can't tell the difference
            One time for a nigga who know
            
            [Chorus]
            Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
            Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
            Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
            Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
            
            [Verse 2]
            No role models, and I'm here right now
            No role models to speak of
            Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
            Last night, I was gettin' my feet rubbed by the baddest bitch
            Not Trina, but I swear to God, this bitch'll make you call your girl up
            And tell her, "Hey, what's good?
            Sorry, I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good"
            Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
            I came fast like 9-1-1 in White neighborhoods
            Ain't got no shame 'bout it
            She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
            I got defensive and said, "Nah, I was the same without it"
            But then I thought back, back to a better me
            Before I was a B-list celebrity
            'Fore I started callin' bitches "bitches" so heavily
            Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody, you wadn't sweatin' me

            [Pre-Chorus]
            One time for my L.A. sisters
            One time for my L.A. ho
            Lame niggas can't tell the difference
            One time for a nigga who know
            
            [Chorus]
            Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
            Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
            Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
            Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
            
            [Verse 3]
            I want a real love, dark-skinned Aunt Viv love
            That Jada and that Will love
            That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
            And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
            Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
            Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
            Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
            Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do', nigga, you know how it go
            She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
            You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
            Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt 'fore she leave
            "I'ma need my shirt back" (Nigga, you know how it go)
            [Pre-Chorus]
            One time for my L.A. sisters
            One time for my L.A. ho
            Lame niggas can't tell the difference
            One time for a nigga who know
            
            [Chorus]
            Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
            Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
            Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
            Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
            
            [Interlude: George W. Bush]
            There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once... shame on... shame on you
            Fool me—can't get fooled again
            
            [Bridge]
            Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)
            Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)
            Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
            Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop, bop, bop)
            Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)
            Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you (Ayy)
            Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
            Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop, bop, bop)
            [Verse 4]
            My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
            My only regret was too young for Nia Long
            Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
            Hand her a script, the bitch prolly couldn't read along
            My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
            My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
            Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
            With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song
            
            [Pre-Chorus]
            She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow, she shallow)
            She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow), yeah, ayy
            (She shallow)
            She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow), haha
            (She shallow)
            She shallow but the pussy deep (She shallow, she shallow)
            
            [Chorus]
            Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
            Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
            Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
            Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
            Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
            Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
            Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
            Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
